## Introduction
The `exporter` tool takes a JSON file generated by the `parser` and writes it 
into a PostgreSQL database.

The `adapter` tool is a versatile addition to the `nlwkn-rs` toolset, designed
to transform the structured JSON data outputted by the `parser` into different
data formats.
This adaptability is crucial for sharing the generated data with various
stakeholders who may require the data in specific formats.
Currently, the tool supports transformation into a flat-table CSV format,
accommodating the need for a single, albeit redundant and sparse, flat table.
