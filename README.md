## About
`nlwkn-rs` is a collection of tools aimed at handling water rights data from the 
"nieders√§chsischen Landesdatenbank f√ºr wasserwirtschaftliche Daten" available at 
[Cadenza](http://www.wasserdaten.niedersachsen.de/cadenza/). 
The platform provides an extensive list of active water rights in 
Lower Saxony, Germany, which can be viewed in a tabular form or visualized on 
a map.

## Project Structure
`lib`: Contains shared code that all tools utilize.
Each tool resides in its own dedicated directory:

- `fetcher`: 
  Contains the tool to fetch water rights in PDF format from the Cadenza 
  database.

- `parser`: 
  Houses the tool to parse these PDF reports and enrich them using an XLSX table 
  that can be downloaded from the Cadenza portal.

For a more detailed overview and instructions specific to each tool, please 
refer to the README in their respective directories.
